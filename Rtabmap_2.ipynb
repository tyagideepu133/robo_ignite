    "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (<b>SLAM</b>) is the name that defines the robotic problem of <b>building a map of an unknown environment while simoultaneously keeping track of the robot's location in the map that is being built</b>. As you may already know, in ROS Navigation you use the slam_gmapping package in order to solve this problem. The slam_gmapping package is based on the OpenSLAM implementation, which uses a laser scanner in order to build a 2D map of the environment, and a particle filter in order to be able to localize the robot in the environment. Great, but... was does this have to do with the current Course?\n",

If you check into the different images, you will notice that there are no yellow discs centered on the homogeneous parts of the image such as the walls or the floor.  Instead, the discs are inserted into areas where there are changes in intensity such as the corners.
